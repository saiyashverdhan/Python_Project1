# FIFA Players Dataset Analysis

This project involves analyzing a **FIFA players dataset** from Kaggle. The dataset includes player stats, team information, contract details, and market values.

The data cleaning process included the removal of duplicates, handling of null values, converting data types, and **standardizing currency values**. New features were created by splitting and transforming columns to extract meaningful insights.

Key insights include identifying players with the **longest contracts**, players with the least value at release, and high-value players with **low salaries**. Visualizations such as scatterplots and barplots were employed to showcase these insights.
